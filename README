fedora-create-review
====================

This project aims at providing a simple way to create a review request
for Fedora on https://bugzilla.redhat.com

See --help for information on how to run the script.
Configuration file will be generated at the first run in
 ~/.config/fedora-create-review
This configuration file contains the target for the scp
command which uploads the file on fedorapeople.

The basic idea of this project is:
- from a spec and srpm
  - start a koji scratch build
  - if build worked
    - upload to fedorapeople.org
    - create the bugzilla ticket
    - Add the koji build in the bugzilla as a link
  - otherwise:
    - warn user


/!\ The future of fedora-create-review
---------------------------------------

This code has now been integrated into FedoraReview.

If I keep the code present here, changes will be applied in both places until
the code diverge. Then FedoraReview will become the official source for this
script.
